# login-page

A user-friendly sign-in page application, built as an introduction to full-stack development.

## Overview

This project is a simple sign-in page with a clean, intuitive design that provides a basic user experience for signing in without a back-end database. It’s designed to store user data in the browser's local storage rather than using a traditional database. This project represents an initial step into full-stack development, including both front-end and basic back-end integration.

## Features

- **Sign-in Page**: A visually appealing and user-friendly design to make the sign-in process smooth and simple.
- **Local Storage**: User data (like username and password) is stored directly in the browser's local storage, allowing for persistent data without a server-side database.
- **No Database Required**: This project does not rely on a back-end database, keeping it lightweight and simple.
- **Introductory Full-Stack Structure**: Although this project doesn’t connect to a live back end, it’s structured to simulate the separation of front-end and back-end layers. This structure serves as a foundation for future improvements, such as adding real back-end functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the front-end structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: To handle logic and interact with local storage.
- **Local Storage**: Used to persist user data on the client side.
